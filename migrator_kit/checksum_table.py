# This checksum table will create a local file to store the checksum. And when the migrator runs, the migrator will consult
# the checksum table to decide whether the migration for the table is necessary. The decision process is to fetch
# checksum for all of the mysql tables, and compare it with the checksum stored. If it doesn't exist or the checksum has
# been changed, the table will be returned as the part of migration process. If not, then nothing will happen.
# Then the checksum table will get updated.

# Checksum shouldn't be none if it's a table we create. So we can ignore tables with checksum "None".
# This table (wtp_data.tables 2827515988), which seems to be a system table, should also get skipped, because
# I can't migrate it.
